**Default branch change!**  
With the release of [v3.3.0](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/releases/tag/v3.3.0) the default branch of Giotto has been moved from [@master](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/tree/master) to [@suite](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/tree/suite). If you want to install the original master version use `devtools::install_github("drieslab/Giotto@master")`. Visit the Giotto [Discussions](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/discussions) page for more information.

**Github Repository changes!**  
The Giotto github repository has moved to https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto and the associated spatial datasets have been moved to https://github.com/drieslab/spatial-datasets. 

**Website change!**  
We have created a new [readthedocs website](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) to further improve and simplify Giotto documentation and to make it easier to use Giotto. It aggregates information from both the original Giotto package and our extended Giotto Suite, which is our extended work-in-development version.  
- www.spatialgiotto.com links to the original [master version](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/master/). The old master pkgdown documentation can still be found at https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/   
- www.giottosuite.com links to the extended [suite version](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The old suite pkgdown documentation can still be found at https://drieslab.github.io/Giotto_site_suite/

Giotto Suite is a major upgrade to the Giotto package that provides tools to process, analyze and visualize **spatial multi-omics data at all scales and multiple resolutions**. The underlying framework is generalizable to virtually all current and emerging spatial technologies. Our Giotto Suite prototype pipeline is generally applicable on various different datasets, such as those created by state-of-the-art spatial technologies, including *in situ* hybridization (seqFISH+, merFISH, osmFISH, CosMx), sequencing (Slide-seq, Visium, STARmap, Seq-Scope, Stereo-Seq) and imaging-based multiplexing/proteomics (CyCIF, MIBI, CODEX). These technologies differ in terms of resolution (subcellular, single cell or multiple cells), spatial dimension (2D vs 3D), molecular modality (protein, RNA, DNA, ...), and throughput (number of cells and analytes). 

The package is in heavy development. Please check back often!  
For a version history/changelog, please see the [NEWS file](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/blob/suite/NEWS.md).
